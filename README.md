# glfw-sys

Rust FFI for linking `glfw` to Rust programs.

# High-level API

This crate provides bindings to the raw low-level C API, as generated by `bindgen`. For a higher-level, safe and complete API see [`glfw-rs`](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/glfw-rs).

# Submodule

Native `glfw` library is included as a submodule to be built and statically-linked against this crate.
At the moment, the submodule points to [`andreinonea/glfw`](https://github.com/andreinonea/glfw) because of some joystick callbacks functionality missing in the upstream repository.
The version of `glfw` is mentioned in the crate version as `<crate>+<glfw>`.
